l26 - defining a function 'checkWin'
        we use a method 'some' with our winningCombinations array to; check
        if at least 1 element in the array meets a specific condition. 

        it will return true; if any of the elements satisfy the condition.
        it will return false; if none of the elements satisfy the condition.


l30 - const [a, b, c] = combo
- here it is 'destructing' to unpack the array into 3 variables, a b c.
- it represents the winning combinations correlated to the winningCombinations. 


l31 - conditions
- this checks if all 3 board positions or cells specified by 'a b c' consist of the current player symbol (X or O)
- Since we're using &&, both conditions need to be true. If these conditions are true, we use the conditions
    in [4] to output whether X or O won.  !!! */
